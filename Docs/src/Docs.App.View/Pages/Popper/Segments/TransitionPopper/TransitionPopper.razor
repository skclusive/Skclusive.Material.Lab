## Transitions

The open/close state of the popper can be animated with a render prop child and a transition component.
This component should respect the following conditions:

- Be a direct child descendent of the popper.
- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.
- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.
  These two callbacks allow the popper to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.

Popper has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).
