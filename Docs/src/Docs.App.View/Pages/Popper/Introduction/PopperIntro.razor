# Popper

<p class=""description"">A Popper can be used to display some content on top of another.</p>

Things to know when using the `Popper` component:

- ðŸ•· Popper relies on the 3rd party library ([Popper.js](https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core)) for perfect positioning.
- ðŸ’„ It's an alternative API to react-popper. It aims for simplicity.
- ðŸ“¦ [8 kB gzipped](/size-snapshot).
- The children is [`Portal`](/components/portal/) to the body of the document to avoid rendering problems.
  You can disable this behavior with `disablePortal`.
- The scroll isn't blocked like with the [`Popover`](/components/popover/) component.
  The alignment of the popper updates with the available area in the viewport.
- Clicking away does not hide the `Popper` component.
  If you need this behavior, you can use [`ClickAwayListener`](/components/click-away-listener/) - see the example in the [menu documentation section](/components/menus/#menulist-composition).
- The `anchorEl` is passed as the reference object to create a new `Popper.js` instance.
