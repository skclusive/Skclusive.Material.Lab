## Issues

### Reporting bugs

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue on GitHub via the repository of the sub-project you think contains the bug. If an issue you have is already reported, please add additional information or add a üëç reaction to indicate your agreement.

Include in the issue a link to your reproduction. A good option is a small Github repo.

### Improving the documentation

Improving the documentation, examples, and other open source content can be the easiest way to contribute to the library. If you see a piece of content that can be better, open a PR with an improvement, no matter how small! If you would like to suggest a big change or major rewrite, we‚Äôd love to hear your ideas but please open an issue for discussion before writing the PR.

### Responding to issues

In addition to reporting issues, a great way to contribute to Skclusive.Material.Component is to respond to other peoples' issues and try to identify the problem or help them work around it. If you‚Äôre interested in taking a more active role in this process, please go ahead and respond to issues.

### Small bug fixes

For a small bug fix change (less than 20 lines of code changed), feel free to open a pull request. We‚Äôll try to merge it as fast as possible and ideally publish a new release on the same day. The only requirement is, make sure you also add a test that verifies the bug you are trying to fix.
